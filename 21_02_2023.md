## What I Learned Today

### Perpetual Futures

- Their main properties are: funding rates, margin (leverage), can take both sides of trade (short/long), and process of liquidation.
- Funding rates are the big innovation and what makes the "perpetual" possible. That is how you maintain the perp price (mark) to hover closely to the real index price (target)
- If bought from AMM, the pool takes the other side of the trade and needs to hedge or it risks losing money.
- In a blockchain based setting you can get the real price of the asset from an outside oracle like _Chainlink_ or from _Uniswap_ on-chain.
- Encountered a [whitepaper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DistributedCollective/sovryn-perpetual-futures/main/docs/SovrynPerpetualsV1_1.9.pdf) explaining this concept very good.
- Another [resource](https://research.paradigm.xyz/cartoon-guide-to-perps) that explains this very good from Paradigm.

### Synthetic Assets

- They are created in _Synthetix_ by staking SNX token, 5/1 ratio.
- If you create _sUSD_ then you need to mirror the pool in order to avoid the risk of deviating from the index.
- You are basically in a zero-sum bubble where if one synth gains in relation to another then it affects everyone in the debt pool.
- Your synths must stay in the 500% range in order to claim rewards.

## Questions

- What is the formula of the funding rates of perps, and why. Need more understanding of why it makes sense.
- How can a perpetual futures protocol hedge its risk when being AMM. Would love to see some real-world implementation of this hedging strategy.
- Need to get more in-depth in regards to the pricing models of these things, liquidation mechanisms, etc.
- If each SNX is $10, and you need 5/1 in SNX to mint 1 sUSD, then why should one sUSD trade equally to one usdc token if it costed you 5 times as much to mint one?
- So whenever you create synths you are essentially borrowing them? You must repay them? Is that why it is called the debt-pool?

## Future Challenges

- Need to implement a Solidity project with all of this things, but very minimalistic to deepen my understandings of the nitty gritty.

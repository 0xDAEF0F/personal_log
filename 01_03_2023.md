## What I Learned Today

### Olympus DAO Audit

#### Main Objective of the Protocol
A reserve-backed token.

#### Key Points

- It is a protocol that issues OHM. It's native token is backed by a reserve of other assets.
- It's strength lies on the treasury's **governance** and **monetary policy**.
- The protocol owns a substantial amount of OHM (protocol owned liquidity) to supply in DEXs.
- Range Bound Stability (RBS) is the way in which the protocol executes market operations to regulate the price of OHM.
- Whenever the price of OHM/reserveX increases a desired bound -- the protocol sells OHM for reserveX.
- Whenever the price of OHM/reserveX decreases a desired bound -- the protocol sells reserveX for OHM.

#### Technical Notes

- For every reserve asset there is an instance of a *PRICE* module contract that handles communication with Chainlink.

## Questions
- When you lend assetA for OHM to the treasury (bonds) at a discounted price, must you redeem assetA? Can you keep the OHM?
- In which ways do the reserves change?
- What are the ways that OHM can be minted?

## Questions

- How do you determine the amount of margin that each user needs for a position?
- So if security A is worth $10 and you allow bob to 10x leverage, with $100 he would be allowed to take a $100 * 10 = $1,000 position. Let's assume price decreases to $9. Now, his position would be worth $900 and his **goodwill** would be over and he would need to be liquidated.
- So essentially more margin equals to more sensitivity in liquidation in terms of the price movements of a security.
- This begs the question of how fast can you react to price swings in order to liquidate people in time. On-chain settings are more complicated.
- What do you base liquidations on? Mark price or index price?
- If an account goes below the maintenance margin, can you downsize it's position to adjust instead of liquidation?
- If you can create perpetuals from a stablecoin and track any off-chain asset then **why** would you need synthetics for?
